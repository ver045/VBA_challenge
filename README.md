## Instructions
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:

-The ticker symbol

-Total stock volume

-Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red

-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year

-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year




## Challenges

The solution will also be able to return the stock with the “Greatest % increase”, “Greatest % Decrease” and “Greatest total volume”

Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once


## Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes

Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button
